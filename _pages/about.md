## About Me

My name is Song-Zi (尚志) Vong, and I was born in a small town in the south of China. Later I studied applied physics at a university in [Guangzhou](https://goo.gl/maps/8YCdV9PrTZ495WPv9), expecting to become a physicist in the future. But I failed due to some personal reasons. After graduating, I accidentally became a game programmer. I’m a freelancer now and still learning mathematics, physics, and programming.

I live in [Foshan](https://goo.gl/maps/zgiuQy3cpFmNan9u7) with two cats:

## About this Blog

The original purpose of this blog is to keep the notes that are mainly useful for me, but I hope it is also worthwhile for others. If I can get some feedback from others, it's better.
